# nnounce Scripting Tutorials

These tutorials serve as introduction to nnounce scripting. Scripts are written using TypeScript and are meant to be run in Deno runtime.

This project contains following folders:
- **snippets** folder contains the simplest snippets aimed to present functions and capabilities of nnounce scripting.
These scripts are prepared in smaller projects to be run either locally in Visual Studio Code or copied directly into the nnounce scripting UI. 
You will also find guidelines for Visual Studio Code environment setup [there](snippets/README.md).
- **examples** folder contains more complex scripts with commentary.
  - There are two tutorials with code meant to be copied into nnounce scripting UI.
    - First [tutorial](examples/tutorial1/README.md) guides you through setup and preparations for playing a file when control input is triggered. 
    - Second [tutorial](examples/tutorial2/README.md) builds on preparations from previous tutorial and adds some complexity. 
  - Two more tutorials show how to manage nnounce devices locally from Visual Studio Code.
    - [Managing a single nnounce device](examples/singleDevice/README.md).
    - [Managing multiple nnounce devices](examples/multipleDevices/README.md).
  - There are also [examples for error handling and how to use try...catch statement](examples/tryCatch/README.md) in your code
- **img** folder contains all images used in tutorials and guidelines
